          <h2>Who is this guy you ask?</h2>
          <p>I'm Sean Arca, 26, currently residing in Chicago. HUGE fan of Chicago sports teams. Currently rooting for both team USA and Argentina for the World Cup. Big Lionel Messi fan! When I was 7 years old, I started playing my first video game on a laptop. At the time, I had no idea that technology would be as advanced as it is today plus make me the big nerd that I am! It also could have happened because I was born in the Philippines, and the culture as a child in most asian countries revolve around competative video games. Almost everyone in your school played something, and that itself, builds a community. Friendships were being made, tensions between players rose, and rivals were formed! But who doesn't love a friendly competition? It all ended at the age of 11, when I moved here to Chicago, where I easily made friends, but none of them were as nerdy as me! Not alot of teens played video games on the PC at the time, so I was forced to play with an online community. I then realized that e-sports organizations were being formed over video games and there was potential for income at my young age of 11. I downloaded photoshop and quickly got the hang of it and started designing logos, banners, and custom site templates for these organizations. I wasn't up to par as some of digital media artists were, nor am I today. But ever since then, I have always had an interest for the art of websites and digital media. I definitely regret not pursuing it then. When I became older, I played more sports, which meant less time on the computer, until it was put behind me for awhile. So before I went to college, I didn't think I could make a living out of digital media. Call me blind. I decided to get into the science field where I now have a bachelors of science from UIC (University of Illinois at Chicago). After my undergraduate degree, I started working for an environmental analysis corporation. So after about a year and a half working there, I then realized, that science really wasn't for me. It's gratifying to think you can do something over and over again with little to no mistakes, but being faced with new challenges on a daily basis AND getting it done, sounded a hell of a lot better. So that's me, a student of startup institute, Sean.</p>
